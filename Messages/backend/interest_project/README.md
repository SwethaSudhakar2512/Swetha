# Project Title: Interest messages

## Description

I create a web application that allows users to send interest messages to other users.
The recipient can then accept or reject the interest, and if accepted, both users can chat with
each other. The project should utilize Django for the backend and Angular or React for the
frontend.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone 'https://github.com/SwethaSudhakar2512/Swetha.git/'
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Messages
    cd backend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    ```

## Running the Project

1. Set up the database (if applicable):
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
